        <para>Note: The difference between using RuntimePlatform and Platform dependent Compilation
is that using RuntimePlatform is evaluated at runtime while Platform dependent Compilation is
evaluated at compile time. So if you can use platform dependent compilation, don't hesitate to use it. In most cases, you can
get the same functionality using both, and using the defines will produce smaller and faster code, as you don't need to check at runtime.
There are some cases where RuntimePlatform is needed, for example: if you need to check which platform you are running a webplayer you may check this
at runtime.</para>

        <para>When locked, the cursor will automatically be centered on view and made to never leave the view. This will primarily be used with Cursor.visible =
false.
When confined, the cursor behave normally with the exception of being confined to the view.In the web player, the cursor may only be locked/confined
after the user has clicked on the content and the user has not left the content view with the cursor.
After the user presses escape or switches to another application the cursor will be automatically reset to normal.
The cursor state will also be lost when exiting full screen mode.To provide a good user experience it is recommended to only lock or confine the
cursor as a result of pressing a button.
Also you should check if the cursor was reset, in order to e.g. pause the game or bring up a game menu.
In the Web Player and Editor the cursor will automatically be reset when you press escape.
In the Standalone Player you have full control over the mouse cursor, thus it won't automatically be reset unless you switch applications.</para>

lighting is already in the light probes and the lightmaps. It is used as the last fallback if light probes or lightmaps are not present or enabled
for an object.Adjusting the ambient probe will not affect the input to realtime and baked Global Illumination. If you want to adjust ambient in a way
that affects GI, adjust ambient through RenderSettings.ambientMode, for instance by using AmbientMode.Trilight. The GI system will output the
resulting ambient values into the ambient probe, which means that a custom ambient probe can be overwritten by the GI system.</para>

        <para>Graphics drivers can queue up frames to be rendered. When CPU has much less work to do than the graphics card,
is it possible for this queue to become quite large. In those cases, user's input will "lag behind"
what is on the screen.Use QualitySettings.maxQueuedFrames to limit maximum number of frames that are queued. The default value is -1,
which does not limit the queue.Note that using a low maxQueuedFrames value can lower your FPS count, because CPU will be waiting until the graphics
card
will finish rendering previous frames. But you will get lower input latency.Currently maxQueuedFrames is only implemented in Direct3D renderer; it
will be ignored in OpenGL.</para>

        <para>Meshes contain vertices and multiple triangle arrays.
See the Procedural example project
for examples of using the mesh interface.The triangle arrays are simply indices into the vertex arrays; three indices for each triangle.For every
vertex there can be a normal, two texture coordinates, color and tangent.
These are optional though and can be removed at will. All vertex information is stored in separate
arrays of the same size, so if your mesh has 10 vertices, you would also have 10-size arrays
for normals and other attributes.There are probably 3 things you might want to use the modifyable mesh interface for:1. Building a mesh from scratch:
should always be done in the following order: 1) assign vertices 2) assign triangles.</para>

        <para>Draw a mesh.</para>
        <para>DrawMesh draws a mesh for one frame. The mesh will be affected by the lights, can cast and receive shadows and be
affected by Projectors - just like it was part of some game object. It can be drawn for all cameras or just for
some specific camera.Use DrawMesh in situations where you want to draw large amount of meshes, but don't want the overhead of creating and
managing game objects. Note that DrawMesh does not draw the mesh immediately; it merely "submits" it for rendering. The mesh
will be rendered as part of normal rendering process. If you want to draw a mesh immediately, use Graphics.DrawMeshNow.Because DrawMesh does not draw
mesh immediately, modifying material properties between calls to this function won't make
the meshes pick up them. If you want to draw series of meshes with the same material, but slightly different
properties (e.g. change color of each mesh), use MaterialPropertyBlock parameter.</para>

        <para>Draw a mesh.</para>
        <para>DrawMesh draws a mesh for one frame. The mesh will be affected by the lights, can cast and receive shadows and be
affected by Projectors - just like it was part of some game object. It can be drawn for all cameras or just for
some specific camera.Use DrawMesh in situations where you want to draw large amount of meshes, but don't want the overhead of creating and
managing game objects. Note that DrawMesh does not draw the mesh immediately; it merely "submits" it for rendering. The mesh
will be rendered as part of normal rendering process. If you want to draw a mesh immediately, use Graphics.DrawMeshNow.Because DrawMesh does not draw
mesh immediately, modifying material properties between calls to this function won't make
the meshes pick up them. If you want to draw series of meshes with the same material, but slightly different
properties (e.g. change color of each mesh), use MaterialPropertyBlock parameter.</para>

The cursor lock will also be lost when exiting full screen mode.
You can query if the cursor is currently locked by checking the lockCursor state.
To provide a good user experience it is recommended to only lock the cursor as a result of pressing a button.
Also you should check if the cursor got unlocked, in order to e.g. pause the game or bring up a game menu.
In the Web Player and Editor the cursor will automatically be unlocked when you press escape.
In the Standalone Player you have full control over mouse locking thus it won't automatically lose mouse lock unless you switch applications.</para>

        <para>Low-level graphics library.</para>
        <para>Use this class to manipulate active transformation matrices,
issue rendering commands similar to OpenGL's immediate mode and do other low-level
graphics tasks. Note that in almost all cases using Graphics.DrawMesh or CommandBuffer
is more efficient than using immediate mode drawing.GL immediate drawing functions use whatever is the "current material" set up right now (see
Material.SetPass).
The material controls how the rendering is done (blending, textures, etc.), so unless you explicitly
set it to something before using GL draw functions, the material can happen to be anything.
Also, if you call any other drawing commands from inside GL drawing code, they can set
material to something else, so make sure it's under control as well.GL drawing commands execute immediately. That means if you call them in Update(),
they will be executed
before the camera is rendered (and the camera will most likely clear the screen, making the GL drawing
not visible).The usual place to call GL drawing is most often in OnPostRender() from a script attached to a
camera, or inside an image effect function (OnRenderImage).</para>

The fact that GameObjects can be culled individually allows run-time to render the same amount of geometry
as it would without batching, unlike combining geometry in the modeling tool. Combining geometry in the modeling tool
prevents efficient culling and results in much higher amount of geometry being rendered.Note that you do not need to call Combine methods on objects
which were already marked as "Static" in the Editor. They will
be prepared for static batching automatically during the Build Player step.IMPORTANT: only objects with the same material can be batched, thus it is
useful to share as many textures/material as you can.</para>

the atlas is compressed and has mipmaps then the lower-level mipmaps might not be
exactly the same as in the original texture due to compression restrictions.If makeNoLongerReadable is true then the texture will be marked as no
longer readable

        <para>Class for handling Sparse Textures.</para>
        <para>Sparse textures are textures where not the whole texture data can be present in memory at once. They are also commonly called "tiled textures" or
"mega textures".Imagine a 16384x16384 texture at 32 bits per pixel - it would take 1GB of memory. The texture is broken down into rectangular
"tiles", and each tile can either be present in memory or not. You can load &amp;amp; unload these tiles as needed based on distance from the camera,
sectors of the world that the player has to see, etc.Otherwise, the sparse textures behave just like any other texture in shaders - they can have
mipmaps, can use all texture filtering modes, etc. If you happen to read from a tile that's not present, you can get undefined result (on many GPUs
the result is a black color, but that's not guaranteed).Note that not all hardware and platforms support sparse textures, so you should check
SystemInfo.supportsSparseTextures before using them. For example, on DirectX systems they require DX11.2 (Windows 8.1) and a fairly recent GPU; and
on OpenGL they require ARB_sparse_texture extension support.After creating the sparse texture, query the tile size with tileWidth &amp;amp; tileHeight.
Tile sizes are platform and GPU dependent.Use UpdateTile or UpdateTileRaw to make a tile resident in memory and update its color data. Use UnloadTile
to unload a tile.</para>

        <para>This function makes a tile at (tileX,tileY) coordinates resident in memory, and updates its pixels. If a tile is already resident, then only the
pixels are updated.Data passed should have enough pixels for the tile (tileWidth*tileHeight elements). Exception can be small mipmap levels that are
smaller than tile size; then it's ok to pass enough data for the mip level size.UpdateTile only works for non-compressed color formats. If you use a
sparse texture with a compressed format, use UpdateTileRaw and pass raw tile data bytes (e.g. DXT-compressed data). UpdateTileRaw can also be more
efficient if texture format is not RGBA32, as then Unity does not have to convert from Color32 data into the underlying texture format.</para>

        <para>Render textures are textures that can be rendered to.</para>
        <para>They can be used to implement image based rendering effects, dynamic shadows,
projectors, reflections or surveillance cameras.One typical usage of render textures is setting them as the "target texture" property
of a Camera (Camera.targetTexture), this will make a camera render into a texture
instead of rendering to the screen.Another use case is manually implementing various rendering effects, for example Image Effects. There you often
get temporary short-lived render textures (GetTemporary and ReleaseTemporary functions), and manually render objects into them (see
Graphics.DrawMeshNow and Graphics.Blit).Keep in mind that render texture contents can become "lost" on certain events, like loading a new level,
system going to a screensaver mode, in and out of fullscreen and so on.
When that happens, your existing render textures will become "not yet created" again,
you can check for that with IsCreated function.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Set bounding distances for 'distance bands' the group should compute, as well as options for how spheres falling into each distance band should be
treated.</para>
        <para>Each distance value indicates a band that is 'up to' that distance; the array [10, 20, 30] describes distance bands "from 0 to 10m", "from 10m to
20m" and "from 20m to 30m."The distance from the reference point (set by CullingGroup.SetDistanceRefPoint) to the nearest edge of the sphere is used
to calculate which distance band a sphere is in. Therefore a sphere that covers multiple distance bands will be considered to be in the nearest one
to the reference point.The distanceBehaviours array describes how a sphere being in a given distance band should have its culling modified. For
example, you might force any object within 20m to be visible even if it is behind the camera (to ensure that characters behind the player are still
running full animation, audio, etc) while forcing any object beyond 200m to be invisible (effectively, culling spheres based on distance).In addition
to forcing objects to be visible or invisible, you can use distance bands to drive level-of-detail changes in your objects. For example, you might
define bands "from 0 to 40m" and "from 40m to 80m", and while you might have both bands apply occlusion and frustum culling as normal, you could have
objects in the second band be animated with a less complex rig, or run a less complex AI behaviour.By default, any spheres beyond the final bounding
distance are implicitly forced to be invisible. To avoid this, you can specify a final bounding distance of float.PositiveInfinity.</para>

        <para>The magnitude of a vector v is calculated as Mathf.Sqrt(Vector3.Dot(v, v)). However, the
Sqrt calculation is quite complicated and takes longer to execute than the normal arithmetic
operations. 
Calculating the squared magnitude instead of using the magnitude property is much faster -
the calculation is basically the same only without the slow Sqrt call. If you are using
magnitudes simply to compare distances, then you can just as well compare squared magnitudes against
the squares of distances since the comparison will give the same result.</para>

Unity internally uses Quaternions to represent all rotations.They are based on complex numbers and are not easy to understand intuitively.
You almost never access or modify individual Quaternion components (x,y,z,w);
most often you would just take existing rotations (e.g. from the Transform) and use them
to construct new rotations (e.g. to smoothly interpolate between two rotations).
The Quaternion functions that you use 99% of the time are:
Quaternion.LookRotation, Quaternion.Angle, Quaternion.Euler, Quaternion.Slerp, Quaternion.FromToRotation, and Quaternion.identity. (The other
functions are only for exotic uses.)You can use the Quaternion.operator * to rotate one rotation by another, or to rotate a vector by a rotation.</para>

        <para>A 2D Rectangle defined by x, y position and width, height.</para>
        <para>The Rect structure is mainly used for 2D operations. The UnityGUI system uses it extensively
 and it is also to set the onscreen position of a Camera's view.The rectangle can be specified in two different ways. The first way involves
 supplying the corner coordinate (usually that's imagined as top-left) along with the width and height.
 This is done using the x, y, width and height properties.
 
The second way to specify the rectangle is to supply the X coordinates of its left
 and right sides and the Y coordinates of its top and bottom sides. These are denoted
 by the xMin, xMax, yMin and yMax properties.Although the x and y properties may seem to be the same as
 xMin and xMax, their behaviour is actually slightly different.
 The x and y values are assumed to be used along with width and height. This
 means that if you change x or y without changing width or height then the
 rectangle will change position but stay the same size. On the other hand, if you change
 the values of xMin or yMin without changing xMax or yMax then the rectangle will
 change size and the top-left corner will also change.</para>

often using Vector3s, Quaternions and functionality of Transform class is more straightforward. Plain matrices are used in special cases
like setting up nonstandard camera projection.Consult any graphics textbook for in depth explanation of transformation matrices.In Unity, Matrix4x4

indexed like 2D arrays but in an expression like mat[a, b], a refers to the row index, while b refers
to the column index (note that this is the opposite way round to Cartesian coordinates).</para>

        <para>Representation of a plane in 3D space.</para>
        <para>A plane is an infinitely large, flat surface that exists in 3D space and divides the space into two halves known as half-spaces. It is easy to
determine which of the two half-spaces a particular point is in and also how far the point is from the plane. Walls, floors and other flat surfaces
are common in games, so a plane is sometimes useful for mathematical calculations with these objects. Also, there are cases where a real surface does
not exist but it is useful to imagine that one is there. For example, in sports, a goal line or out-of-bounds line is often assumed to extend into
the air, effectively defining a plane.When a plane passes through the &amp;lt;0,0,0&amp;gt; point in world space, it is defined simply by a normal vector
that determines which way it faces. It is easy to visualise this if you imagine looking at the plane edge-on.Note that the side from which the normal
vector points is important since it is used to identify which half-space a point is in (ie, on the positive or "normal" side of the plane or the
other side). When the plane doesn't pass through &amp;lt;0,0,0&amp;gt; it can be defined by the normal vector along with a distance from &amp;lt;0,0,0&amp;gt;A plane
can also be defined by the three corner points of a triangle that lies within the plane. In this case, the normal vector points toward you if the
corner points go around clockwise as you look at the triangle face-on..</para>

        <para>This is similar to the modulo operator but it works with floating point numbers. For example, using 3.0 for t and 2.5 for length, the result would be
0.5. With t = 5 and length = 2.5, the result would be 0.0. Note, however, that the behaviour is not defined for negative numbers as it is for the

        <para>Perlin noise is a pseudo-random pattern of float values generated across a 2D plane (although
the technique does generalise to three or more dimensions, this is not implemented in Unity).
The noise does not contain a completely random value at each point but rather consists
of "waves" whose values gradually increase and decrease across the pattern. The noise can
be used as the basis for texture effects but also for animation, generating terrain heightmaps
and many other things.Perlin noise sampled in the range 0..10 (the greyscale values represent values from 0..1)Any point in the plane can be sampled
by passing the appropriate X and Y coordinates. The
same coordinates will always return the same sample value but the plane is essentially infinite
so it is easy to avoid repetition by choosing a random area to sample from.</para>

can be set to none.
RPC function names should be unique accross the scene, if two RPC functions in different scripts 
have the same name only one of them is called when RPC is invoked.
RPC calls are always guaranteed to be executed in the same order as they are sent.
The communication group set for the network view, with NetworkView.group, is used for the RPC call.
To get information on the RPC itelf, you can add a NetworkMessageInfo parameter to the function declaration
which will automatically contain the information. You don't need to change the way you call the RPC
function when you do this. For more information see the RPC section of the manual.

* Uses AES encryption. Prevents unauthorized reads and blocks replay attacks
* Adds CRCs so that data tampering can be detected.
* Uses randomized, encrypted SYNCookies to prevent unauthorized logins.
* Uses RSA encryption to protect the AES key.
Most games will want to use secure connections.

        <para>Two types of tests are performed depending on if the machine has a public IP address present or if it only has a private address (or addresses). The
public IP address test is primarily for when running a server as no tests are needed for clients with public addresses. In order

IP and port of the local server and thus it is shown in the server is connectable. If not then a firewall is most likely
blocking the server port. A server instance needs to be running so that the test server has something to connect
to.The other test is for checking NAT punchthrough capabilities. This is a valid test for both servers and clients
and can be performed without any prior setup. There are 4 types of NAT test results (see ConnectionTesterStatus): __Full Cone_, Address Restricted
Cone, Port restricted and 
Symmetric.First two types offer full NAT punchthrough support and can connect to any type. Port restricted type cannot connect to or receive a
connection from symmetric
type. Symmetric if worst and cannot connect to other symmetric types or port restricted type. The latter two are labelled
as offering limited NAT punchthrough support.This function is asynchronous and might not return a valid result right away because the tests needs
some time to complete (1-2 seconds). After test completion the test result is only returned when the function is called again, 
a full network test is not redone. That way it is safe to poll the function frequently. If another test is desired,

        <para>The proxy server is a solution to connectivity problems with servers
as well as clients. When a machine has an non NAT punchthrough capable
router his connectivity options are limited. A game cannot be hosted
as nobody external can connect to him (only clients on the local network can).
By using the proxy server the machine can be fully connectable but with
the extra cost of having all traffic relayed through another server.
A non NAT punchthrough capable client can connect to any server through 
the proxy server, as long as the proxy server is set up properly.Unity Technologies does not provide a proxy server for public use, so to
use this feature you will need to set up your own proxy server. Of course
it is advisable to set up a proxy server with a public IP address and
a lot of available bandwidth.When running as a client, just enabling Network.useProxy is all you have
to do. Connect to the server as usual with Network.Connect(). All traffic 
will be relayed through the proxy server. The servers external IP and internal
IP still work as usual. So clients can connect to him directly without
the proxy in case they are located on the same network.When running as a server OnServerInitialized(NetworkPlayer) returns a
NetworkPlayer structure which indicates what the game servers relayed
IP/port is, i.e. what port the proxy server allocated to the game server. 
This is the IP/port others can use to connect to. When connecting to the
server, the clients don't treat the server any differently than other servers.
Technically speaking, they don't need to know at all that the game server
is getting help from a proxy server. When using the master server you can no longer only rely on the IP/port he
registers for servers when using proxy support. The proxy server IP address
and port which the server is using can be placed in the comment field of
the data sent to the master server. A client which received host information
from the master server can peek into the comment field and find out if
he can use an alternative IP/port for that host.IMPORTANT: You should never enable proxy support for both the server and
the client connecting to him. Unexpected things are bound to happen.</para>

        <para>Command buffers hold list of rendering commands ("set render target, draw mesh, ..."). They can be set to execute at various points during camera
rendering (see Camera.AddCommandBuffer), light rendering (see Light.AddCommandBuffer) or be executed immediately (see
Graphics.ExecuteCommandBuffer).Typically they would be used to extend Unity's rendering pipeline in some custom ways. For example, you could render
some additional objects into deferred rendering g-buffer after all regular objects are done, or do custom processing of light
shadow maps. See command buffers overview page for more details.Command buffers can be created and then executed many times if needed.</para>

        <para>The Resources class allows you to find and access Objects including assets.</para>
        <para>In the editor, Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll can be used to locate assets and scene objects.All assets that are in a folder named "Resources"
anywhere in the Assets folder can be accessed via the Resources.Load functions.
Multiple "Resources" folders may exist and when loading objects each will be examined.In Unity you usually don't use path names to access assets,
instead you expose a reference to an
asset by declaring a member-variable, and then assign it in the inspector.
When using this technique Unity can automatically calculate which assets are used when building a player.
This radically minimizes the size of your players to the assets that you actually use in the built game.
When you place assets in "Resources" folders this can not be done, thus all assets in the "Resources" folders will be included in a build.Another
disadvantage of using path names is that it leads to less reusable code since scripts will have specific hard coded requirements on where the used
assets are placed.
On the other hand using references that are exposed in the inspector are self-documenting and immediately obvious to the user of your script.However
there are situations where it is more convenient to fetch an asset by its name instead of linking to it in the inspector.
Essentially whenever it is inconvenient to assign the reference to the object in the inspector.
For example you might want to create a game object procedurally from a script and for example assign a texture to a procedurally generated mesh.Some
loaded assets, most notably textures, can use up memory even when no instance exists in the scene. To reclaim this memory when the asset is no longer
needed, you can use Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.</para>

        <para>Force Unity to serialize a private field.</para>
        <para>You will almost never need this.
When Unity serializes your scripts, it will only serialize public fields.
If in addition to that you also want Unity to serialize one of your private fields
you can add the SerializeField attribute to the field.
Unity will serialize all your script components, reload the new assemblies,
and recreate your script components from the serialized verions. This
serialization does not happen with .NET's serialization functionality, but
with an internal Unity one.The serialization system used can do the following:- CAN serialize public nonstatic fields (of serializable types)
- CAN serialize nonpublic nonstatic fields marked with the [SerializeField] attribute.
- CANNOT serialize static fields.
- CANNOT serialize properties.Your field will only serialize if it is of a type that Unity can serialize:Serializable types are:- All classes
inheriting from UnityEngine.Object, for example GameObject, Component, MonoBehaviour, Texture2D, AnimationClip.
- All basic data types like int, string, float, bool.
- Some built-in types like Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Quaternion, Matrix4x4, Color, Rect, LayerMask.
- Arrays of a serializable type
- List of a serializable type)
- Enums
- StructsNote: if you put one element in a list (or array) twice, when the
list gets serialized, you'll get two copies of that element, instead of one copy being in the new list twice.Hint: Unity won't serialize Dictionary,
however you could store a List&amp;lt;&amp;gt; for
keys and a List&amp;lt;&amp;gt; for values, and sew them up in a non serialized dictionary
on Awake(). This doesn't solve the problem of when you want to modify the
dictionary and have it "saved" back, but it is a handy trick in a lot of other cases.For UnityScript users: Fields in c# is a script variable in
UnityScript, and
[SerializeField] becomes @SerializeField. [Serializable] on a class becomes @script Serializable in a UnityScript.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Implement this method to receive a callback after unity serialized your object.</para>
        <para>In contrast to many other programming environments where you often creates objects yourself by invoking constructors, Unity will often create objects
for you, and set its fields with the values that you set for them in the Editor.The process of setting the fields of your objects, and getting them,
is called deserialization and serialization respectively.
Unity's serializer is able to serialize many different kinds of fields, but not all of them. In those cases it can be convenient to get a callback
before unity will read from your fields, or after it has written to them, to allow you to do some custom steps. A typical use case for this would be
if you have an object graph that you know how to serialize, but Unity does not. In that case, you can implement INotifyOnSerialization interface, and
before Unity will read your fields,  you manually serialize your object graph into your fields in a way that Unity can serialize. You can do the
reverse in the OnDeserialize method.The interface can be used on MonoBehaviours like in the example, but it can also be used on custom classes and
structs.This interface should be used very carefully. Unity's serializer usually runs on the non main thread, while most of the Unity API can only be
called from the main thread. Your code is also running interleaved with Unity's serializing code, (the callbacks are not deferred), so you could
seriously confuse Unity's serializer by modifying the very objects Unity is reading from and writing to. You're strongly recommended to only use this
interface for the example use case mentioned above: serializing something yourself that Unity doesn't know how to.Another caveat is that
serialization happens more often than you might think. When a MonoBehaviour gets cloned through Instantiate() at runtime, it gets deserialized and
serialized.  If the object had a field that pointed to its own gameObject,  when that gameObject gets cloned, you'd want the field to point to the
new gameObject, not the old one. In order to update these "internal references", Unity uses the serialization system. Unity reads all your fields,
finds references to "things that were cloned", and then writes the new values in your fields. The callbacks will also be invoked for this updating
phase, allowing you to make the updating of internal references to also work in your custom classes that Unity cannot serialize.Currently only
classes will receive the callbacks. Structs will not.</para>

functions that load objects (Resources.LoadAsync, AssetBundle.LoadAssetAsync, AssetBundle.LoadAllAssetAsync), scenes (Application.LoadLevelAsync,
Application.LoadLevelAdditiveAsync) do data read and deserealization on a separate background loading thread and object integration on a main thread.
Integration depends on an object type and for textures, meshes means uploading data to the GPU, audio clips prepare data for playing. To avoid
hiccups we limit integration time on a main thread depending on backgroundLoadingPriority value:- ThreadPriority.Low - 2ms;-
ThreadPriority.BelowNormal - 4ms;- ThreadPriority.Normal - 10ms;- ThreadPriority.High - 50ms.
This is a maximum time all asynchronous operations can spend within a single frame on a main thread.Background loading thread uses
backgroundLoadingPriority directly.</para>

        <para>Opaque objects are sorted by various criteria (sorting layers, shader queues,

of state changes and improve draw call batching), and to maximize GPU efficiency
(many GPUs prefer rough front-to-back rendering order for faster rejection of invisible
surfaces).By default, opaque objects are grouped in rough front-to-back buckets, on the GPUs
where doing that is beneficial. There are GPUs where doing this distance based
sorting is not really helpful (most notably, PowerVR/Apple GPUs), and so on these GPUs
the distance based sorting is not done by default.The Camera.opaqueSortMode property lets you override this default behavior.
For example, you might want to never do distance-based sorting for opaque objects,
if you know you need much more CPU performance than GPU performance.</para>

        <para>Normally Camera skips rendering of objects that are further away than farClipPlane.
You can set up some Layers to use smaller culling distances using layerCullDistances.
This is very useful to cull small objects early on, if you put them into appropriate layers.When assigning layerCullDistances, you need to assign
float array that has 32 values.
Zero values in cull distances means "use far plane distance".By default, per-layer culling will use a plane aligned with the camera. You can change
this to
a sphere by setting layerCullSpherical on the Camera to true.</para>

        <para>When using Deferred Shading or Legacy Deferred Lighting, the g-buffer and lighting passes use the stencil buffer.
By default contents of the stencil buffer are preserved (not cleared) and end up containing information related
to lights. Setting this property to true makes
stencil be cleared to zero after the deferred light pass is done.Typically if you're using deferred shading camera and UI elements with Masks (see

        <para>Devices can track a number of different pieces of data about a touch on a touchscreen, including its phase (ie, whether it has just started, ended or
moved), its position and whether the touch was a single contact or several taps. Furthermore, the continuity of a touch between frame updates can be
detected by the device, so a consistent ID number can be reported across frames and used to determine how a particular finger is moving.The Touch
struct is used by Unity to store data relating to a single touch instance and is returned by the Input.GetTouch function. Fresh calls to GetTouch
will be required on each frame update to obtain the latest touch information from the device but the fingerId property can be used to identify the
same touch between frames.</para>

        <para>All current touches are reported in the Input.touches array or by using the Input.GetTouch function with the equivalent array index. However, the
array index is not guaranteed to be the same from one frame to the next. The fingerId value, however, consistently refers to the same touch across
frames. This ID value is very useful when analysing gestures and is more reliable than identifying fingers by their proximity to previous position,
etc.Touch.fingerId is not the same as "first" touch, "second" touch and so on. It is merely a unique id per gesture. You cannot make any assumptions
about fingerId and the number of fingers actually on screen, since virtual touches will be introduced to handle the fact that the touch structure is
constant for an entire frame (while in reality the number of touches obviously might not be true, e.g. if multiple tappings occur within a single
frame).</para>

        <para>Interface into the Input system.</para>
        <para>Use this class to read the axes set up in the Input Manager, and to access
multi-touch/accelerometer data on mobile devices.To read an axis use Input.GetAxis with one of the following default axes:
"Horizontal" and "Vertical" are mapped to joystick, A, W, S, D and the arrow keys.
"Mouse X" and "Mouse Y" are mapped to the mouse delta.
"Fire1", "Fire2" "Fire3" are mapped to Ctrl, Alt, Cmd keys and three mouse or joystick buttons.
New input axes can be added in the Input Manager.If you are using input for any kind of movement behaviour use Input.GetAxis.
It gives you smoothed and configurable input that can be mapped to keyboard, joystick or mouse.
Use Input.GetButton for action like events only. Don't use it for movement, Input.GetAxis will make the script code smaller and simpler.Note also
that the Input flags are not reset until "Update()", so its suggested you make all the Input Calls in the Update Loop.Mobile Devices:iOS and Android
devices are capable of tracking multiple fingers touching the screen simultaneously.
You can access data on the status of each finger touching screen during the last frame by accessing the Input.touches property array.As a device
moves, its accelerometer hardware reports linear acceleration changes along the three primary axes in three-dimensional space.
You can use this data to detect both the current orientation of the device (relative to the ground) and any immediate changes to that
orientation.Acceleration along each axis is reported directly by the hardware as G-force values.
A value of 1.0 represents a load of about +1g along a given axis while a value of -1.0 represents -1g.
If you hold the device upright (with the home button at the bottom) in front of you, the X axis is positive along the right,
the Y axis is positive directly up, and the Z axis is positive pointing toward you.You can read the Input.acceleration property to get the
accelerometer reading.
You can also use the Input.deviceOrientation property to get a discrete evaluation of the device's orientation in three-dimensional space.
Detecting a change in orientation can be useful if you want to create game behaviors when the user rotates the device to hold it differently.Note
that the accelerometer hardware can be polled more than once per frame.
To access all accelerometer samples since the last frame, you can read the Input.accelerationEvents property array.
This can be useful when reconstructing player motions, feeding acceleration data into a predictor, or implementing other precise motion analysis.</para>

        <para>Some languages use complex input methods which involve opening windows to insert characters.
Typically, this is not desirable while playing a game, as games may just interpret key strokes
as game input, not as text. By default, Unity will enable IME composition when in text fields,
and disable it otherwise. However, when you want to implement your own input GUI, you may want
to have control over this yourself, which is possible using the imeCompositionMode property. Set
it to Auto for the default behavior, or On or Off to explicitly enable or disable IME
composition.</para>

        <para>In some languages such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, text is input by typing multiple keys to generate
one or multiple characters. These characters are visually composed on the screen as the user types.
When using Unity's built in GUI system for text input, Unity will take care of displaying the composition
strings as the users types. If you want to implement your own GUI, however, you need to take care of
displaying the string at the current cursor position. The composition string is only updated when IME

so the IME needs to know where input is displayed. When using Unity's built in GUI system for text input,
Unity will take care of setting the cursor position for the IME. However, if you wish to implement your

        <para>Position, rotation and scale of an object.</para>
        <para>Every object in a scene has a Transform.
It's used to store and manipulate the position, rotation and scale of the object.
Every Transform can have a parent, which allows you to apply position, rotation and scale hierarchically. This is the hierarchy seen in the Hierarchy
pane.
They also support enumerators so you can loop through children using:</para>

Thus scale can not be represented correctly in a 3 component vector but only a 3x3 matrix.
Such a representation is quite inconvenient to work with however.
lossyScale is a convenience property that attempts to match the actual world scale as much as it can.
If your objects are not skewed the value will be completely correct and

delta time.Note that you should not rely on Time.deltaTime from inside OnGUI since OnGUI

realtimeSinceStartup also keeps increasing while the player is paused (in the background).
Using realtimeSinceStartup is useful when you want to pause the game by setting Time.timeScale to zero,
but still want to be able to measure time somehow.Note that realtimeSinceStartup returns time as reported by system timer. Depending on
the platform and the hardware, it may report the same time even in several consecutive
frames. If you're dividing something by time difference, take this into account
(time difference may become zero!).</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Sets the seed for the random number generator.</para>
        <para>The random number generator is not truly random but produces numbers in a preset sequence (the values in the sequence "jump" around the range in such
a way that they appear random for most purposes).The point in the sequence where a particular run of pseudo-random values begins is selected using an
integer called the seed value. The seed is normally set from some arbitrary value like the system clock before the random number functions are used.
This prevents the same run of values from occurring each time a game is played and thus avoids predictable gameplay. However, it is sometimes useful
to produce the same run of pseudo-random values on demand by setting the seed yourself.You might set your own seed, for example,  when you generate a
game level procedurally. You can use randomly-chosen elements to make the scene look arbitrary and natural but set the seed to a preset value before
generating. This will make sure that the same "random" pattern is produced each time the game is played. This can often be an effective way to reduce
a game's storage requirements - you can generate as many levels as you like procedurally and store each one using nothing more than an integer seed
value.</para>

        <para>Playables are customizable runtime objects that can be connected together in a tree to create complex behaviours.</para>
        <para>Playables can be used to create complex and flexible data evaluation trees. They can be connected together (via Playable.Connect), after which each
Playable in the tree can set the "weight" or "influence" of each of its children. Once a tree of Playable is created, it can be "played" by using it
with a DirectorPlayer component. (see DirectorPlayer.Play)Once a Playable (or tree of Playable) is associated with a DirectorPlayer, the player will
traverse the Playables one by one. Each time it encounters a Playable in the tree, it will call its PrepareFrame method. This allows the Playable to
"prepare itself for the next evaluation". It is during the PrepareFrame stage that each Playable can modify its children (either by adding new inputs
or by removing some of them). This enables Playable to "spawn" new children branches in the Playable tree at runtime. This means that Playable trees
are not static structures. They can adapt and change over time.AnimationPlayables are a good example usage of the Playables. They allow existing
AnimationClips to be connected together via AnimationPlayableMixers, on the fly. This can be used to programatically create animation behaviours such
as locomotion blendtrees. Once a tree of AnimationPlayables is created, it can be passed to an Animator component via the Animator.Play method.</para>

        <para>Playables can be connected together to form a tree structure. Each Playable has a set of inputs and a set of outputs. These can be viewed as
â€œslotsâ€ where other Playables can be attached to.When a Playable is first created, its input count is reset to 0, meaning that it has no children
Playables attached. Outputs behave a little differentlyâ€”every Playable has a default output created when first created.You connect Playables
together using the static method Playable.Connect, and you can disconnect them from each other using Playable.Disconnect. The Playable.Connect method
takes optional index parameters. These indicates which in which â€œslotâ€ you would like to connect the Playables. Calling Playable.Connect without
any index will add a new input to the target Playable and will connect the source Playableâ€™s default output. When disconnecting a Playable, the
input â€œslotâ€ on the target Playable is not removed. Meaning that the number of inputs on a Playable never shrinks (unless you call
Playable.ClearInputs, in which case all inputs are disconnect and the input array is resized to 0).There is no limit set on the amount of inputs a
Playable can have.</para>

        <para>WheelFrictionCurve is used by the <see cref="WheelCollider">WheelCollider</see> to describe friction properties of the wheel tire.</para>
        <para>The curve takes a measure of tire slip as an input and gives a force as output. The curve is approximated by
a two-piece spline. The first section goes from (0,0) to (extremumSlip,extremumValue), at which
point the curve's tangent is zero. The second section goes from (extremumSlip,extremumValue)
to (asymptoteSlip,asymptoteValue), where curve's tangent is again zero:Wheel collider computes friction separately from the rest of physics engine,
using a slip based
friction model. It separates the overall friction force into a "forwards" component (in the
direction of rolling, and responsible for acceleration and braking) and "sideways" component
(orthogonal to rolling, responsible for keeping the car oriented). Tire friction is described
separately in these directions using WheelCollider.forwardFriction and WheelCollider.sidewaysFriction.
In both directions it is first determined how much the tire is slipping (what is the speed difference between
the rubber and the road). Then this slip value is used to find out tire force exerted on the contact.The property of real tires is that for low slip
they can exert high forces as the rubber compensates
for the slip by stretching. Later when the slip gets really high, the forces are reduced as the tire
starts to slide or spin. Thus tire friction curves have a shape like in the image above.Because the friction for the tires is computed separately,
the PhysicMaterial of the ground
does not affect the wheels. Simulation of different road materials is done by changing
the WheelCollider.forwardFriction and WheelCollider.sidewaysFriction of the wheel,
based on what material the wheel is hitting.</para>

        <para>Control of an object's position through physics simulation.</para>
        <para>Adding a Rigidbody component to an object will put its motion under the control of Unity's physics engine. Even without adding any code, a Rigidbody
object will be pulled downward by gravity and will react to collisions with incoming objects if the right Collider component is also present. The
Rigidbody also has a scripting API that lets you apply forces to the object and control it in a physically realistic way. For example, a car's
behaviour can be specified in terms of the forces applied by the wheels. Given this information, the physics engine can handle most other aspects of
the car's motion, so it will accelerate realistically and respond correctly to collisions.In a script, the FixedUpdate function is recommended as the
place to apply forces and change Rigidbody settings (as opposed to Update, which is used for most other frame update tasks). The reason for this is
that physics updates are carried out in measured time steps that don't coincide with the frame update. FixedUpdate is called immediately before each
physics update and so any changes made there will be processed directly.A common problem when starting out with Rigidbodies is that the game physics
appears to run in "slow motion". This is actually due to the scale used for your models. The default gravity settings assume that one world unit
corresponds to one metre of distance. With non-physical games, it doesn't make much difference if your models are all 100 units long but when using
physics, they will be treated as very large objects. If a large scale is used for objects that are supposed to be small, they will appear to fall
very slowly - the physics engine thinks they are very large objects falling over very large distances. With this in mind, be sure to keep your
objects more or less at their scale in real life (so a car should be about 4 units = 4 metres, for example).</para>

        <para>This flag has a connection with rigidbodies that have some of their rotational degrees of freedom frozed. The common example is a 2D game that uses
3D rigidbodies with some of their translational and rotational degrees of freedom frozen.Rigidbody rotations freezing is internally implemented by
setting an infinite inertia around those frozen axes so that the body does not rotate because it's very resistant to. This approach has some nice
properties: most significantly it lets such bodies to correctly go to sleep as opposed to the approach where we would cancel out the rotations around
the frozen axes as a post-solver step.However the downside is that very stiff solver constraints can be generated when such bodies are connected with
joints. When the flag is set, PhysX would ignore constraints that produce huge impulses generating only a small change in velocity. Whilst it may
reduce the overall accuracy of the joint simulation, it's been proven to help with overconstrained configurations like in the 2D case.</para>

influence on handling by modulating the time it takes for the vehicle to respond to bumps in the road and on the amount of load experienced by the
tire.  Larger values make the suspension reach the target position faster but at the cost of increased load and handling variability.  Smaller values
provide a smoother but less responsive ride.The value suspensionSpring.damper describes the rate at which the spring dissipates the energy stored in
the spring. It is expressed in Newtons seconds per metre (equivalent to Newtons per unit speed). Larger values make the suspension reach the target
position slower, while lower values make the car appear more bouncy.  Vehicle suspensions typically have a response close to critical damping.The
rest coordinate of the wheel is specified by suspensionSpring.targetPosition.  This value describes the rest coordinate of the wheel as a fraction in
range (0, 1) along the suspensionDistance. Zero value maps to full extension along the suspension travel,  while a value of one maps to fully
compressed suspension. Default value is 0.5, which sets the rest coordinate of the wheel to the mid-point between the suspension at maximum

coordinate of the wheel is determined by the value WheelCollider.spring.targetPosition).  This parameter simulates the effective roll center of the
suspension geometry.  For a standard family car the value of forceAppPointDistance should be tuned to place the application point approximately 0.3m
below the rigid body center of mass.  Moving the application point downwards introduces more roll when cornering, while moving it upwards results in
less roll when cornering. The force application point is typically below the rigid body center of mass.Please note that having this parameter equal
to zero could be undesirable as it contributes to simulation instability in certain configurations. Once you observe your vehicle failing to go
asleep resting on flat surface, exhibiting jittering behavior or drifting along the surface when no user input is applied, check the
forceAppPointDistance values. In the editor, when a WheelCollider game object is selected, there is a green spherical gizmo displayed to show where

        <para>Casts a box against colliders in the scene, returning all colliders that contact with it.</para>
        <para>A BoxCast is conceptually like dragging a box through the scene in a particular direction.  Any object making contact with the box can be detected
and reported.This function is similar to the BoxCast function but instead of detecting just the first collider that is hit, an array of all colliders
along the path of the box is returned. The colliders in the array are sorted in order of distance from the origin point. The layerMask can be used to
detect objects selectively only on certain layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy characters, for example).The returned
RaycastHit2D returns both the point and normal of the contact where the box would touch the collider.  It also returns the centroid where the box
would be positioned for it to contact at that point.</para>

        <para>A raycast is conceptually like a laser beam that is fired from a point in space along a particular direction. Any object making contact with the beam
can be detected and reported.This function returns a RaycastHit object with a reference to the collider that is hit by the ray (the collider property
of the result will be NULL if nothing was hit). The layerMask can be used to detect objects selectively only on certain layers (this allows you to
apply the detection only to enemy characters, for example).Raycasts are useful for determining lines of sight, targets hit by gunfire and for many
other purposes in gameplay.Additionally, this will also detect Collider(s) at the start of the ray.  In this case the ray is starting inside the
Collider and doesn't intersect the Collider surface.  This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated in which case the collision normal
returned is set to the inverse of the ray vector being tested.  This can easily be detected because such results are always at a RaycastHit2D
fraction of zero.</para>

scripts using forces. By adding the appropriate collider component, the sprite will also respond to collisions with other sprites. This behaviour

        <para>Interpolation is used to estimate the position of the Rigidbody between physics updates. It can be useful to switch this on when the graphics update
is much more frequent than the physics update because the object can appear to move along in jerky "hops" rather than having smooth motion. With
interpolate mode, motion is smoothed based on the object's positions in previous frames. Extrapolate mode smooths motion based on an estimate of its
position in the next frame. The choice of mode depends of the dynamics of the object during gameplay.</para>

(including: moving towards destination, collision avoidance, and acceleration control) and command the NavMesh Agent to move using the specific
velocity directly. When the agent is controlled using a velocity, its movement is still constrained on the NavMesh.Setting the velocity directly can
be used for implementing player characters which are moving on NavMesh and affecting the rest of the simulated crowd. In addition, setting priority
to high (a small value is higher priority), will make other simulated agents to avoid the player controlled agent even more eagerly.It is recommended
to set the velocity each frame when controlling the agent manually, and if releasing the control to the simulation, set the velocity to zero. If
agentâ€™s velocity is set to some value and then stopped updating it, the simulation will pick up from there and the agent will slowly decelerate
(assuming no destination is set).Note that reading the velocity will always return value from the simulation. If you set the value, the effect will
show up in the next update. Since the returned velocity comes from the simulation (including avoidance and collision handling), it can be different

recalculated when necessary. The recalculation logic has two options: 1) carve when stationary, 2) carve when moved."Carve when stationary" is the
default behavior and is used when carveOnlyStationary is set to true. The obstacle is treated as moving when it has moved more than the distance set
by carvingMoveThreshold. At this time, the carved hole is removed. When the obstacle has stopped moving, and has been stationary more than
carvingTimeToStationary seconds, the obstacles is treated stationary and carving is updated again. While the obstacle is moving, the agents will
avoid it using the collision avoidance, but will not plan paths around it. This mode is generally the best choice in terms of performance. It is good
match when the game object is controlled by physics (i.e. crates and barrels)."Carve when moved" behavior is used when carveOnlyStationary is set to
false. In this mode the carved hole is updated when the obstacle has moved more than the distance set by carvingMoveThreshold. This mode is well

In order to play 3D sounds you also need to have a AudioListener.
The audio listener is normally attached to the camera you want to use.
Whether sounds are played in 3D or 2D is determined by AudioImporter settings.You can play a single audio clip using Play, Pause and Stop.
You can also adjust its volume while playing using the volume property, or seek using time.
Multiple sounds can be played on one AudioSource using PlayOneShot.

        <para>This pan is applied before 3D panning calculations are considered. In other words, stereo panning affects the left right balance of the sound before
it is spatialised in 3D.Mono sounds are panned from left to right using constant power panning (non linear fade). This means when pan = 0.0, the
balance for the sound in each speaker is 71% left and 71% right, not 50% left and 50% right. This gives (audibly) smoother pans.Stereo sounds heave
each left/right value faded up and down according to the specified pan position. This means when pan = 0.0, the balance for the sound in each speaker
is 100% left and 100% right. When pan = -1.0, only the left channel of the stereo sound is audible, when pan = 1.0, only the right channel of the
stereo sound is audible.Values range from -1.0 to 1.0. -1.0 = Full left

custom spatialization effects as optional plugins through the native audio plugin system, and in case such plugins are present, will show a
"Spatialize" checkbox on the AudioSource that corresponds to this property. If no plugin is present (and selected in the project audio settings),
attempts to set this property to true will fail with a warning.</para>

        <para>The range from 0 to 1 is linear (like the volume property) while the range from 1 to 1.1 is an extra boost range that allows you to boost the
reverberated signal by 10 dB. The associated curve in combination with the distance-based attenuation curve is useful when trying to simulate
transitions from near-field to distant sounds.Note that prior to Unity 5.0 reverb zones were not applied to 2D sounds. With the generalization of 2D
and 3D sounds in Unity 5.0 through the Spatial Blend parameter the reverb can now be applied to any sound. Therefore when importing Unity projects
made with versions prior to 5.0 this parameter will be set to 0 for all the sounds that were 2D sounds, but is now adjustable.</para>

Unity uses fair weighting, which means if a lower layer wants 80% and 50% have already been used up, the layer will NOT use up all weights.

This property controls how much slack is available in the arm joints. The value is given in world distance units in the range 0..1. For example, with

out by translating both the elbow and wrist transforms.The ideal value will depend on the rig and the animation but in general, a larger value will

Continue response code is intended to allow a remote server to decide whether or not it will accept a request based on a request's headers, prior to
the client transmitting the full request body.This is useful in cases where the client need not transmit its full request to every server in a
request/response chain, such as in a load-balanced application. For example, a client would present its request, with a Expect: 100-Continue header,
to a load-balancing server. The load-balancing server would then respond with a redirect to a processing server. Next, the client would connect to
the processing server and transmit the same request, again with a Expect: 100-Continue server. The processing server would then respond with a 100
Continue HTTP status code, and the client would finally respond with the full body of its request.By using the 100 Continue status code, the client
only had to transmit the full body of its request to one server. If not using the 100 Continue status code, the client must transmit the full body of
its request to every server it communicates with, needlessly consuming bandwidth and processing time on both the client and any servers issuing
redirects.In general, one should leave 100 Continue enabled. Exceptions include requests which have a very small or no request body, or applications
where the client knows the server will not issue a redirect.This property defaults to true.Note: On WebGL build targets, header negotiation is
performed by the host browser. Therefore, this setting's value has no effect on WebGL builds.</para>

non-WebGL platforms, the system will prepend http:. On WebGL, the system will inherit the scheme of the path by which the Unity WebGL application is
being accessed.Examples: If the WebGL app is being accessed via https, the system will prepend https:. If the WebGL app is being accessed via http,
the system will prepend http:.If the input URL starts with a single slash (/), then the system assumes the inout is a path relative to the current
domain on which the Unity application is running. On non-WebGL platforms, the system will prepend http://localhost to the URL.On WebGL, the system
will prepend the scheme and host of the path by which the Unity WebGL application is being accessed. For example, if the Unity WebGL app is being
accessed via http://unity3d.com/myapp, then the system will prepend http://unity3d.com to relative paths.If neither of the above rules apply, the
system validates your input string via the built-in System.Uri class. If this class throws a URIFormatException, the system attempts to append the

Content-Length header is not received).Note: When accessing DownloadHandler.data or DownloadHandler.text on this subclass, a new byte array or string
will be allocated each time the property is accessed.</para>

        <para>On its own, a DownloadHandlerScript object does no useful work.Instead, it forwards data received from the network to the DownloadHandler.ReceiveData
callback method, as well as invoking other useful callbacks for download-related events. By default, a DownloadHandlerScript does nothing; however,
you can derive your own subclass from DownloadHandlerScript, override some or all of its callbacks and thereby implement completely custom data

DownloadHandler.ReceiveData must be used to discover which bytes are new.When in this mode, the DownloadHandlerScript will not allocate any memory

        <para>iOS GameCenter implementation for network services.</para>
        <para>An application bundle ID must be registered on iTunes Connect
before it can access GameCenter. This ID must be properly set in
the iOS player properties in Unity. When debugging you can use the GameCenter
sandbox (a text displaying this is shown when logging on). You
must log on in the application to get into sandbox mode, logging
on in the GameCenter application will always use the production version.When using the GameCenterPlatform class in C# you need to include the 
UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms.GameCenter namespace.Some things to be aware of when using the generic API:Authenticate()
If the user is not logged in, a standard GameKit UI is shown 
where he can log on or create a new user. It is recommended
this is done as early as possible.Achievement descriptions and Leaderboards
The achivements descriptions and leaderboard configurations can be configured in the 
iTunes Connect portal. Achievements get unique identifiers and the
leaderboards use category names as identifiers.GameCenter Sandbox
Development applications use the GameCenter Sandbox. This is a seperate GameCenter
than the live one, nothing is shared between them. It is recommended that you
create a seperate user for testing with the GameCenter Sandbox, you should not use
your real Apple ID for this. You can only log on to the sandbox through a development
application, make sure you are not logged into GameCenter using the GameCenter app before
testing begins. You should see *** Sandbox *** in the login dialog, if you don't see this
then you are logging on to the real one. Sometime it happens that the OS forgets that the
application is using the sandbox and you will be logged on to the real one. If the application
has not be submitted to Apple already then this will probably result in an error. To fix this
all that needs to be done is to delete the app and redeploy with Xcode. To make another apple 
ID a friend of a sandbox user it needs to be a sandbox user as well.If you start getting errors when accessing GameCenter stating that the
application is not recognized you'll need to delete the application complately and re-deploy.
Make sure you are not logged on when starting the newly installed application again.</para>

        <para>A depth render texture format.</para>
        <para>Depth format is used to render high precision "depth" value into a render texture. Which format
is actually used depends on the platform. On OpenGL it is the native "depth component" format
(usually 24 or 16 bits), on Direct3D9 it is the 32 bit floating point ("R32F") format. When writing
shaders that use or render into a depth texture, care must be taken to ensure that they work both
on OpenGL and on Direct3D, see depth textures documentation.Note that not all graphics cards support depth textures. Use

        <para>Opaque objects are sorted by various criteria (sorting layers, shader queues,
materials, distance, lightmaps etc.) to maximize both the CPU efficiency (reduce number
of state changes and improve draw call batching), and to maximize GPU efficiency
(many GPUs prefer rough front-to-back rendering order for faster rejection of invisible
surfaces).By default, opaque objects are grouped in rough front-to-back buckets, on the GPUs
where doing that is beneficial. There are GPUs where doing this distance based
sorting is not really helpful (most notably, PowerVR/Apple GPUs), and so on these GPUs
the distance based sorting is not done by default.The Camera.opaqueSortMode property lets you override this default behavior.
For example, you might want to never do distance-based sorting for opaque objects,
if you know you need much more CPU performance than GPU performance.</para>

        <para>The Assert class contains assertion methods for setting invariants in the code.</para>
        <para>All method calls will be conditionally included only in the development builds, unless explicitly specified (see BuildOptions.ForceEnableAssertions).
The inclusion of the assertions is controlled by UNITY_ASSERTIONS define. 

A failure of an assertion method does not break the control flow of the execution. On a failure, an assertion message is logged (LogType.Assert) and
the execution continues. If Assert.raiseExceptions is set to true, an AssertionException is thrown instead of logging a message.

If a debugger is attached to the project (System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached is true), AssertionException will be thrown in order to pause the
excecution and invoke the debugger.

        <para>When you create a build, Unity will try to strip unused code from your project. This is great to get small builds. However, sometimes you want some
code to not be stripped, even if it looks like it is not used. This can happen for instance if you use reflection to call a method, or instantiate an
object of a certain class.
You can apply the [Preserve] attribute to classes, methods, fields and properties. In addition to using PreserveAttribute, you can also use the
traditional method of a link.xml file to tell the linker to not remove things. PreserveAttribute only works on IL2CPP platforms. The link.xml file
works for Mono and IL2CPP platforms.</para>
