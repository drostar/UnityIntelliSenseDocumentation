        <para>Note: The documentation that follows is for usage of Unity Analytics with Unity 5.1 and above. To integrate Unity Analytics with earlier versions of
Unity, refer to the documentation at https://analytics.cloud.unity3d.com/docsSpecifically, out-of-the-box features include access to user engagement
and retention data through Metric Monitor and Data Explorer. Segmentation of players across various user dimensions and characteristics is
automatically applied, with more than 20 standard segments available without any additional instrumentation.For more detail around features, refer to
the Unity Analytics homepage at http://unity3d.com/unity/analytics.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Custom Events (optional).</para>
        <para>Unity Analytics allows you to track specific events within your game. By configuring a series of Custom Events within your game, you can create your
own Funnel Analysis to observe your players' game behavior. Good places to put custom events include: milestones, new levels, scene transitions,
etc.In addition to tracking custom events, Unity Analytics also allows you to pass in custom dimensions (dictionary) relating to the event. These
custom dimensions are primarily useful to know additional specifications about the user at the time the custom event was reached.</para>

      <param name="customEventName">Name of custom event. Name cannot include the prefix "unity." - This is a reserved keyword.</param>
