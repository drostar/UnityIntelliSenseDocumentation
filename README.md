# UnityIntelliSenseDocumentation
XML Documentation that enables IntelliSense code hints for the Unity game engine libraries.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<P>Copy the XML files into your Unity program folder in the following locations:</P>
<P>
UnityEngine.xml and UnityEditor.xml → C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed<br/>
UnityEngine.UI.xml → C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\UnityExtensions\Unity\GUISystem\4.6.0<br/>
UnityEditor.UI.xml → C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\UnityExtensions\Unity\GUISystem\4.6.0\Editor
</P>
<P>If you’re using Visual Studio Tools for Unity (formerly UnityVS) then you’ll also need to copy all XML files into the project’s Library/UnityAssemblies subfolder. You’ll need to do this for each project with UnityVS after generating the Visual Studio project files.</P>
